I am a **PhD student in Mechanical Engineering at Memorial University of Newfoundland**, where I a mamber of **At. Astra Research Group**. My work combines **molecular dynamics simulations** with planetary and materials science to uncover how **space weathering** transforms the surfaces of airless bodies (like the Moon and Mercury) and materials.

ðŸŒ‘ **Surface chemistry across planets and materials**  
I study surfaces as active chemical systems â€” whether lunar regolith, mercurian soil, small-body dust, or engineered nanocomposites. Under solar wind ion implantation and micrometeoroid impact, these surfaces undergo bond-breaking, recombination, and rapid diffusion that produce and release volatiles (e.g. OH, Hâ‚‚O, Na), sputter atoms and molecules, and permanently change material properties. Molecular dynamics lets us watch these transformations atom-by-atom, linking laboratory and spacecraft signals to the physics that produced them.

ðŸ§ª **From atomic mechanisms to practical outcomes**  
This isnâ€™t purely academic. The same processes that drive exosphere composition and surface hydration also control how real materials age and fail under radiation and impact. By quantifying adsorption/desorption kinetics, sputtering yields, and material damage pathways my research:  
- helps planetary scientists interpret volatile measurements and exospheric variability;  
- informs the design of materials (aerospace, nuclear, and exploration hardware) with improved radiation tolerance and impact resilience;  
- provides predictive inputs for multiscale models that scale atomistic behavior up to mission- and system-level forecasts.
   
The result is research that simultaneously advances our understanding of the Solar System and delivers actionable knowledge for materials engineering.

### ðŸ”¬ Research Highlights
- **Water formation on the Moon** â€“ Molecular dynamics simulations showing solar wind and micrometeoroid impacts as dual drivers of OH/Hâ‚‚O chemistry.  
- **Sodium release from silicates** â€“ Atomistic models of adsorption, diffusion, and desorption processes of sodium from silicates.  
- **Molecules sputter too** â€“ Using reactive molecular dynamics to reveal that not only atoms, but also complex molecules, can be ejected under solar wind bombardment.
- **Degradation of materials in space** - Using atomic scale simulations to study the degradation mechanisms of advanced materials under the extreme environments of space. 

### ðŸš€ Vision
By bridging **planetary/materials science, and computational modeling**, my goal is to answer fundamental questions about the evolution and  surface modifications of planets and materials.
