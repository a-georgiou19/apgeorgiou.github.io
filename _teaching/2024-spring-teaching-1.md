I have been the lead Teaching Assistant for Mechanical Design Project I since Spring 2024. In this course the students are asked to design and build an RC Plane (< 2kg) with the goal to lift as much payload as possible.  

Tasks:
======
* Prepared lectures for students in the areas of design principles, aerodynamics, structures, propulsion and stability.
* Graded presentations and design reports.
* Incorporated the BMFA Payload Challenge grading system to encourange students to think outside the box.
* Focus on the design principles of DFMA.
