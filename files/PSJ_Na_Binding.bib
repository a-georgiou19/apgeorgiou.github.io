abstract = {The collisionless atmospheres of the Moon and Mercury allow for different space weathering processes to occur on their surfaces. During these processes, atoms can be ejected ballistically into the exosphere, a portion of which will eventually return to the surface. These returning atoms can then adsorb on the surface with a binding energy (BE) different than that of the mineral. However, it is unknown how adsorbates sample the different possible binding sites on the surface, or how diffusion can dynamically affect the BEs and eventual desorption process. Here, we conduct molecular dynamics simulations of the adsorption, diffusion, and desorption of sodium (Na) atoms on different silicates relevant to the Moon and Mercury. We consider the effect of crystallinity and temperature on the BE and diffusion behavior of adsorbed Na over time. Results show that Na adsorption strongly depends on the surface mineral composition and the presence of bridging and nonbridging oxygen. Na on silica surfaces had the highest adsorption energy compared to albite and anorthite due to the higher proportion of exposed nonbridging oxygens on the surface. We also observe that the BE increases as the Na atoms are allowed to diffuse and desorb. This suggests that while adsorbates may initially randomly sample different binding sites, with time they will diffuse toward high-BE sites. Finally, our simulations show that with an increase in temperature, there is an increased probability of desorption.}
