I am a **PhD student in Mechanical Engineering at Memorial University of Newfoundland**, where I a mamber of **At. Astra Research Group**. My work combines **molecular dynamics simulations** with planetary science to uncover how **space weathering** transforms the surfaces of airless bodies like the Moon and Mercury.

ðŸŒ‘ **How does the Moon make its own water?**  
My research reveals the hidden chemistry of solar wind and micrometeoroid impacts, showing how they drive the formation, retention, and release of water and other volatiles. These atomic-scale insights help explain puzzling spacecraft observations and reshape our understanding of planetary surfaceâ€“exosphere interactions.

ðŸ§ª **Why does this matter?**  
Space weathering alters the chemistry, optical properties, and durability of planetary materials. By modelling adsorption, diffusion, and sputtering processes at the atomic level, I provide a mechanistic view of how materials respond to extreme environments. This work not only advances planetary science, but also contributes to **materials research under radiation and impact conditions** â€” with applications ranging from **lunar resource utilization** to **nuclear materials design**.

### ðŸ”¬ Research Highlights
- **Water formation on the Moon** â€“ First-principles simulations showing solar wind and micrometeoroid impacts as dual drivers of OH/Hâ‚‚O chemistry.  
- **Sodium release from silicates** â€“ Atomistic models of adsorption, diffusion, and desorption processes that regulate exosphere dynamics.  
- **Molecules sputter too** â€“ Using reactive force fields to reveal that not only atoms, but also complex molecules, can be ejected under solar wind bombardment.

### ðŸš€ Vision
By bridging **planetary science, materials physics, and computational modeling**, my goal is to answer fundamental questions about the evolution of planetary surfaces â€” and to pave the way for future exploration and resource use beyond Earth.
