I have been the lead **Teaching Assistant** for Mechanical Design Project I since Spring 2024. In this course, students are tasked with designing and building an RC plane (< 2 kg) with the goal of lifting the maximum possible payload.  

Tasks:
======
* Prepared lectures on design principles, aerodynamics, structures, propulsion, and stability.
* Graded student presentations and design reports.
* Applied the BMFA Payload Challenge (a well established competition) grading system to encourage creativity and innovation.
* Integrated local and international standards to familiarize students with industry protocols. 
* Emphasized the design principles of Design for Manufacturing and Assembly (DFMA).
